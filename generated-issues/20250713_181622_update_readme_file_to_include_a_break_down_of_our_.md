[INFO] Your configured model (gemini-2.5-pro) was temporarily unavailable. Switched to gemini-2.5-flash for this session.
I cannot locate the `.cs` files for the card and set data models within the current directory `C:\Users\Steve\Projects\.dev-issue-generator`. It appears this directory is for development issue generation, not the main project codebase.

To proceed with the feature research, I need to know the absolute path to the root directory of your .NET Core project where the data models are defined. Please provide the correct path.
