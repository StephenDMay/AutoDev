# FEATURE: BaseAgent Abstract Class

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature introduces a `BaseAgent` abstract base class (ABC) to establish a standardized contract for all agents within the system. By defining a common `execute` method, we ensure architectural consistency, simplify agent management, and enable seamless integration of new agents.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
- **Existing Components**: The current implementation has an `example_agent` with a standalone `agent.py`. This file contains a simple `run` function, but no formal class structure.
- **Integration Points**: The `BaseAgent` will become the core interface for all future agents. The central orchestration logic will interact with agent instances through the `BaseAgent` contract, specifically the `execute` method.
- **Architectural Impact**: This change moves the system from loosely-coupled scripts to a more formal, object-oriented, and extensible agent architecture. It introduces a foundational abstraction that the rest of the agent management system will be built upon. No significant technical debt is incurred; this is a foundational improvement.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
- **User Workflows**: Developers creating new agents will subclass `BaseAgent`, which provides a clear and predictable development pattern. They will know exactly which methods they need to implement for their agent to be compliant with the system.
- **Industry Best Practices**: Using abstract base classes to define common interfaces is a standard and highly effective design pattern in object-oriented systems. It promotes loose coupling and high cohesion. Frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen use similar base abstractions for their agents or tools.
- **Competitive Analysis**: Most agent-based automation frameworks (e.g., AutoGen, CrewAI) rely on a base class to define agent capabilities and ensure they can be managed by the core orchestration engine. This is a proven and necessary architectural pattern for this domain.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is to use Python's built-in `abc` module to create a `BaseAgent` abstract class. This class will define an abstract method `execute`, which all concrete agent implementations must override.

- **`BaseAgent` Class**:
    - Reside in a new file: `agents/base_agent.py`.
    - Inherit from `abc.ABC`.
    - Define an abstract method: `@abc.abstractmethod def execute(self, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:`. The signature is kept flexible to accommodate diverse agent needs, but it will be the orchestrator's responsibility to provide the correct arguments.

- **Refactor `ExampleAgent`**:
    - The existing `example_agent/agent.py` will be modified to define an `ExampleAgent` class that inherits from `BaseAgent`.
    - The logic from the current `run` function will be moved into the `execute` method.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
None. This is a code architecture change.

### API Design
None. This change is internal to the agent execution framework.

### Frontend Components
None.

### Backend Services
- **`agents/base_agent.py` (New File)**: Will contain the `BaseAgent` abstract class.
- **`agents/example_agent/agent.py` (Modification)**: The existing script will be refactored into a class `ExampleAgent(BaseAgent)` that implements the `execute` method.
- **Orchestration Logic (Future)**: The core logic that runs agents will be designed to load agent classes and call the `execute` method, relying on the `BaseAgent` interface.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Over-abstraction**: Defining the interface too rigidly too early could constrain future agent designs.
    - **Mitigation**: Keep the `execute` method signature flexible (e.g., using `*args, **kwargs`) to allow for varied agent inputs and outputs. The initial implementation will be simple.
- **Integration Complexity**: The central orchestrator needs to be able to discover and instantiate these new agent classes.
    - **Mitigation**: A simple discovery mechanism (e.g., scanning directories and importing modules) will be implemented as a separate, subsequent feature. For now, instantiation can be direct.

### Business Risks
- **Reduced Velocity (Short-Term)**: Developers must now adhere to a class-based structure instead of writing simple scripts, which might slightly slow down initial agent creation.
    - **Mitigation**: Provide clear documentation and a simple, well-commented `ExampleAgent` to serve as a template. The long-term benefits of consistency far outweigh this minor initial friction.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: 0.5 days
**Dependencies**: None. This is a foundational feature.
**Priority**: High
**Category**: technical-debt

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Files to Create**:
    - `agents/base_agent.py`
- **Files to Modify**:
    - `agents/example_agent/agent.py`
- **Key Classes/Functions to Implement**:
    - `agents.base_agent.BaseAgent`: An abstract class inheriting from `abc.ABC`.
    - `agents.base_agent.BaseAgent.execute`: An abstract method.
    - `agents.example_agent.agent.ExampleAgent`: A concrete class inheriting from `BaseAgent` and implementing the `execute` method.
- **CLI Command Structure**: No CLI changes. This is a programmatic API.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - The `BaseAgent` class exists and cannot be instantiated directly.
    - The `ExampleAgent` class inherits from `BaseAgent` and implements the `execute` method.
    - A simple test script can import `ExampleAgent`, instantiate it, and call the `execute` method successfully.

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
**IN SCOPE**:
- Creating the `BaseAgent` abstract class with an `execute` abstract method.
- Refactoring the `example_agent` to be a class that inherits from `BaseAgent`.

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- The orchestration logic that discovers, loads, and runs agents.
- Any form of inter-agent communication.
- Passing complex state or context to the `execute` method.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] `agents/base_agent.py` is created with the `BaseAgent` ABC.
- [ ] `BaseAgent` has an abstract method named `execute`.
- [ ] `agents/example_agent/agent.py` is refactored to contain an `ExampleAgent` class.
- [ ] `ExampleAgent` inherits from `BaseAgent` and provides a concrete implementation of the `execute` method.
- [ ] Attempting to instantiate `BaseAgent` directly raises a `TypeError`.
