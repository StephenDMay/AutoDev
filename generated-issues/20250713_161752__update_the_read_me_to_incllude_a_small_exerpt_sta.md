I will start by analyzing the project's `README.md` to understand its current structure and content. This will help determine the best place to add the new information.# FEATURE: Update README with Dev Automation Note

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature involves updating the main `README.md` file to include a small excerpt about our ongoing experiments with development automation. This change improves transparency for contributors and users about our internal engineering practices.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The change is confined to a single documentation file, `README.md`. The automation being referenced is embodied in the PowerShell scripts within the repository (e.g., `dev-issue.ps1`, `tcg-api.ps1`). This is a non-functional, documentation-only update with no impact on the existing architecture or codebase.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
It is a common and good practice in software projects to document the development tools and automation used. This provides context for new contributors, explains the purpose of certain repository files (like the `.ps1` scripts), and signals a commitment to improving development efficiency.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is to add a new, brief section to the `README.md` file, likely after the introductory "What It Does" section. This ensures high visibility without disrupting the flow of the existing documentation. The content should be a simple statement about the use of PowerShell scripts for automation.
