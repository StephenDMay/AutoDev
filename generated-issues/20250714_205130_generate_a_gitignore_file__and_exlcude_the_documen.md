# FEATURE: Generate .gitignore file

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature automatically generates a standard Python `.gitignore` file in the project root. It ensures that common unnecessary files (like `__pycache__`, virtual environments, and IDE configs) are ignored by version control, while also providing the flexibility to exclude specific directories from being ignored, such as the `documentation/` folder.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The project is a Python application, identified by the presence of `.py` files. It is already a Git repository, indicated by the `.git/` directory. Currently, there is no `.gitignore` file, meaning all files are potentially tracked. The `generated-issues/` directory contains output files that should be ignored. The `documentation/` directory needs to be explicitly included in version control. This feature will create a new `.gitignore` file at the project root.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
Developers universally use `.gitignore` files to maintain a clean and secure repository. Standard practice is to ignore IDE configuration files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`), dependency caches (`.venv/`, `node_modules/`), compiled files (`*.pyc`), and environment-specific files (`.env`). Services like `gitignore.io` and GitHub's templates are the industry standard for generating these files. The primary user pain point this solves is the manual and error-prone process of creating this file for every new project, especially remembering to not commit sensitive information or build artifacts.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is to create a new script or a function within an existing development script (e.g., `dev-issue.py`) that writes a standard Python `.gitignore` content string to a `.gitignore` file in the project's root directory.

To ensure the `documentation/` directory is tracked, the rule `!documentation/` will be appended to the end of the file. This explicitly overrides any broader rule (like `*` or `docs/`) that might otherwise cause it to be ignored.

An alternative would be to fetch the template dynamically from an external API like `gitignore.io`, but this introduces an external dependency and potential point of failure for a simple task. The self-contained approach is more reliable.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
None. This feature does not interact with a database.

### API Design
None. This is a local file system operation.

### Frontend Components
None. This is a CLI/backend feature.

### Backend Services
A new function, `generate_gitignore()`, will be created.
**Logic:**
1.  Define a multi-line string containing a standard `.gitignore` template for Python projects. This should include entries for `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, common virtual environment folders (`.venv`, `venv`), IDE folders (`.idea`, `.vscode`), and the local `generated-issues/` directory.
2.  Check if a `.gitignore` file already exists in the project root.
3.  If it exists, prompt the user for confirmation before overwriting.
4.  Write the template string to the `.gitignore` file.
5.  Append the line `!documentation/` to the file to ensure it is not ignored.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Overwriting Existing File**: An existing, manually configured `.gitignore` could be overwritten.
  - **Mitigation**: The implementation will check for the file's existence and require user confirmation before proceeding with an overwrite.

### Business Risks
- **Incorrectly Ignoring Files**: A poorly configured template could ignore critical project files.
  - **Mitigation**: Use a widely accepted, standard template for Python projects as the base. Clearly log which files and directories are being ignored upon creation.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: < 1 day
**Dependencies**: None
**Priority**: High
**Category**: feature

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] A `.gitignore` file is created in the project root.
- [ ] Running `git status` shows that files inside `generated-issues/` are ignored.
- [ ] Running `git status` shows that files inside `documentation/` are still tracked by Git.
- [ ] The system warns the user if a `.gitignore` file already exists and asks for confirmation to overwrite.
