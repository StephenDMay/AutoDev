Okay, I will now begin the feature analysis. First, I need to analyze the existing codebase to understand the current architecture and identify integration points. I'll start by reading the key files related to agents and configuration.# ---

# FEATURE: Agent-Specific Configuration Resolution

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature introduces a hierarchical configuration system where each agent can have its own `config.json` file. This allows for modular and independent agent development, enabling developers to override global settings and manage agent-specific parameters, prompts, and secrets without modifying a central configuration file.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The current system uses a singleton `ConfigManager` (`core/config_manager.py`) to load a single, global `dev-automation.config.json`. The `AgentOrchestrator` (`agents/orchestrator.py`) discovers and loads agents from subdirectories. During agent instantiation, it currently attempts to pull agent-specific configuration from a dedicated key within the global config file. The `BaseAgent` (`agents/base_agent.py`) already accepts a `config` dictionary in its constructor, providing a perfect injection point for the resolved configuration. This feature will modify the `AgentOrchestrator` to find, load, and merge an agent's local `config.json` at runtime.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
In plug-in and agent-based architectures, co-locating configuration with the component itself is a standard best practice. It enhances modularity, simplifies maintenance, and reduces the risk of conflicts in a shared global configuration. Developers expect to be able to define an agent's unique settings (e.g., API endpoints, model parameters, specialized prompts) within the agent's own directory. A common pattern is a hierarchical merge, where global settings provide defaults and agent-specific settings provide overrides. This approach is seen in many popular frameworks and tools (e.g., VS Code extensions, webpack loaders).

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is to modify the `AgentOrchestrator.load_agents` method to implement a configuration resolution strategy.

1.  **Global Config as Base**: The orchestrator will maintain the global configuration loaded by `config_manager` as the base set of defaults for all agents.
2.  **Local Config Discovery**: For each agent being loaded, the orchestrator will check for a `config.json` file within the agent's specific directory (e.g., `agents/my_agent/config.json`).
3.  **Hierarchical Merge**: If `config.json` is found, it will be loaded and its contents will be merged over a *copy* of the global configuration. The merge strategy will be a shallow `dict.update()`, meaning top-level keys in the agent's config will overwrite top-level keys from the global config.
4.  **Injection**: The resulting merged configuration dictionary will be passed to the agent's constructor. If no local `config.json` is found, the agent will receive the original global configuration.

An alternative would be to implement deep merging, but this adds complexity. A shallow merge is sufficient for the initial implementation and is easier to reason about.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
None.

### API Design
None.

### Frontend Components
None.

### Backend Services
**`agents/orchestrator.py`**
- The `load_agents` method will be modified. The logic for instantiating an agent will be updated as follows:

```python
# Inside the loop of AgentOrchestrator.load_agents
try:
    # ... (existing code to load manifest and agent_class) ...

    # 1. Start with a copy of the global config
    final_config = config_manager.get_all().copy() # Requires a new get_all() method in ConfigManager

    # 2. Check for and load agent-specific config
    agent_config_path = os.path.join(agent_path, 'config.json')
    if os.path.exists(agent_config_path):
        with open(agent_config_path, 'r') as f:
            agent_specific_config = json.load(f)
        # 3. Merge agent config over global config
        final_config.update(agent_specific_config)

    # 4. Instantiate agent with the final merged config
    self.agents[manifest['name']] = agent_class(config=final_config)
    
    # ... (existing exception handling) ...
except Exception as e:
    # ...
```

**`core/config_manager.py`**
- A new method `get_all()` will be added to return the entire configuration dictionary.

```python
# In ConfigManager class
def get_all(self) -> dict:
    """Returns a copy of the entire configuration dictionary."""
    return self._config.copy()
```

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Complex Merging Needs**: A simple shallow merge (`dict.update`) might be insufficient if agents require deep merging of nested objects (e.g., `llm_settings`).
  - **Mitigation**: Document the shallow merge behavior clearly. If deep merging becomes necessary, a well-tested utility library can be introduced in a future iteration.
- **Missing Config Keys**: An agent might be coded to expect a configuration key that is not present in either the global or local config.
  - **Mitigation**: Agents should be coded defensively using `config.get('key', default_value)` to prevent `KeyError` exceptions. This should be documented as a best practice for agent developers.

### Business Risks
- **Configuration Confusion**: Developers might be unsure which configuration (global vs. local) is being applied.
  - **Mitigation**: Add logging during agent loading that indicates when a local `config.json` is found and merged. Clear documentation and a working example in the codebase are also essential.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: < 1 day
**Dependencies**: None. This builds on existing components.
**Priority**: High. This is a foundational feature for creating a robust and scalable multi-agent system.
**Category**: feature

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Files to Modify**:
    1.  `core/config_manager.py`: Add the `get_all()` method.
    2.  `agents/orchestrator.py`: Update the `load_agents()` method with the new config resolution logic.
- **Files to Create**:
    1.  `agents/example_agent/config.json`: A new file to demonstrate the feature. It should contain a key that overrides a value from the global `dev-automation.config.json` or adds a new agent-specific key.
- **Key Classes/Functions**:
    - `ConfigManager.get_all`
    - `AgentOrchestrator.load_agents`
- **CLI Structure**: No changes to the CLI itself, but this feature enables the agent-based CLI described in `dev-issue.py` (`main_agent_based`) to function correctly with customized agents.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: See below.

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
**IN SCOPE**:
- Modifying the `AgentOrchestrator` to find and load `config.json` from agent directories.
- Implementing a shallow-merge strategy (agent config overwrites global).
- Passing the final merged config to the agent constructor.
- Creating one example `config.json` for the `example_agent`.

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- Implementing deep-merging of configurations.
- A secrets management system (e.g., Vault, environment variable injection). For now, any secrets in config should be git-ignored.
- Dynamic reloading of configuration while the application is running.
- Refactoring the `dev-issue.py` CLI to be fully agent-driven (this feature is a prerequisite for that work).

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] A `get_all()` method exists on the `ConfigManager` class and returns the full configuration dictionary.
- [ ] The `AgentOrchestrator` looks for a `config.json` file in each agent's directory.
- [ ] If `agents/example_agent/config.json` exists, its values overwrite any identically named top-level keys from the global configuration for the `example_agent`.
- [ ] The `ExampleAgent` instance receives the correctly merged configuration in its constructor.
- [ ] If an agent directory does not contain a `config.json`, the agent is still loaded successfully with the global configuration.
- [ ] The system remains functional and existing behavior is unchanged if no `config.json` files are present.
