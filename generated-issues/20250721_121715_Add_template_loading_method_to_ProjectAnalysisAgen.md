# FEATURE: Add template loading method to ProjectAnalysisAgent

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature adds a method to the `ProjectAnalysisAgent` to load and process a markdown template file. This allows for dynamic generation of analysis prompts, making the agent more flexible and easier to maintain.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The `ProjectAnalysisAgent` in `agents/project_analysis_agent/agent.py` is responsible for analyzing the project structure. It currently constructs a hardcoded prompt for the LLM. The `project_analysis_template.md` file contains the template to be used. The agent's configuration is in `agents/project_analysis_agent/config.json`. The integration test `tests/integration/test_project_analysis_agent.py` can be extended to verify the new functionality.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
For a system that automates software development, using templates for prompts is a common practice. It allows for easier customization and evolution of the prompts without changing the agent's code. This is a key aspect of building a flexible and maintainable multi-agent system.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is to add a new private method, `_load_and_prepare_template`, to the `ProjectAnalysisAgent`. This method will:
1.  Read the template file specified in the agent's configuration.
2.  Replace placeholders in the template with dynamic content (e.g., directory structure, key file content).
3.  Return the processed prompt.

The `execute` method will then be updated to use this new method instead of the hardcoded prompt.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
No database changes are required.

### API Design
No API changes are required.

### Frontend Components
No frontend components are affected.

### Backend Services
The `ProjectAnalysisAgent` will be modified as described above.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Template Not Found**: The specified template file might not exist. - **Mitigation**: The agent should handle this gracefully, logging an error and falling back to a default prompt or raising an exception.
- **Placeholder Mismatch**: The placeholders in the template might not match the data provided by the agent. - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation and validation of the template placeholders.

### Business Risks
- **Reduced Performance**: Loading and processing the template might add a small overhead. - **Mitigation**: This is expected to be negligible, but can be monitored.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day
**Dependencies**: None
**Priority**: High
**Category**: feature

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Files to modify**:
    - `agents/project_analysis_agent/agent.py`
    - `tests/integration/test_project_analysis_agent.py`
- **Key classes/functions to implement**:
    - `ProjectAnalysisAgent._load_and_prepare_template(self, template_path: Path, context: Dict) -> str`
- **Clear acceptance criteria for "done"**:
    - The `ProjectAnalysisAgent` loads the analysis prompt from a template file.
    - Placeholders in the template are correctly replaced with dynamic content.
    - The agent functions correctly when the template is present.
    - The agent handles the case where the template is missing.
    - Integration tests are updated to cover the new functionality.

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
**IN SCOPE**:
- Adding the template loading and processing logic to `ProjectAnalysisAgent`.
- Updating the `execute` method to use the template.
- Updating integration tests.

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- Creating new templates.
- Adding support for other template engines.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] `ProjectAnalysisAgent` loads its prompt from `project_analysis_template.md`.
- [ ] Placeholders in the template are replaced with the correct data.
- [ ] The agent's `execute` method uses the template-generated prompt.
- [ ] The integration test for the agent is updated to verify the template usage.

## GITHUB ISSUE TEMPLATE
**Title**: Feature: Add template loading to ProjectAnalysisAgent
**Labels**: enhancement, project-analysis
**Assignee**:
**Project**: Loom Phase 1I will now add a method to the `ProjectAnalysisAgent` to load the analysis prompt from the `project_analysis_template.md` file. I'll also update the `execute` method to use this new template loading functionality and modify the integration test to verify the changes.
