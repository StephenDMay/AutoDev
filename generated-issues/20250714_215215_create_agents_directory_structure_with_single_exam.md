# FEATURE: Agent Directory Structure and Example Agent

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature establishes a foundational directory structure for managing "Agents" within the AutoDev system. By creating a dedicated `agents` directory and providing a simple example agent, we enable clear organization and provide a straightforward template for developers to create their own custom automation agents, making the system extensible and easy to understand.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The current project structure includes a `templates` directory containing Python script templates (`api.py`, `data.py`, etc.). The proposed `agents` directory will be a new top-level directory, similar in spirit to `templates` but specifically for self-contained, executable agents. No existing code directly conflicts with this, but the agent-running logic (to be developed later) will need to be aware of this new directory. This is a non-breaking, additive change. The `dev-automation.config.json` may eventually need a section for agent configuration, but it is not required for this initial scaffolding task.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
In the domain of developer tools and AI orchestration (e.g., CrewAI, LangChain, Auto-GPT), an "agent" is a common abstraction for an autonomous entity that performs tasks. Best practices show that these systems benefit from a clear, discoverable structure for defining and managing agents. A common pattern is a directory-based approach where each subdirectory represents an agent, containing its logic and a manifest file for metadata. This lowers the barrier to entry for developers wanting to extend the system, which is a key goal for our target users.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is to create a main `agents` directory at the project root. Inside, each agent will have its own subdirectory, which serves as its unique namespace.

1.  **Directory Structure**:
    -   `agents/`
        -   `example_agent/`
            -   `agent.py`
            -   `manifest.json`

2.  **Agent Logic (`agent.py`)**: This file will contain the agent's core logic. Initially, it can be a simple Python class with a `run()` method. This approach is simple and aligns with the Python-centric tech stack.

3.  **Agent Manifest (`manifest.json`)**: A simple JSON file to describe the agent's metadata. This addresses the "Project Understanding" and "Model API Differences" constraints by allowing agents to declare their purpose, capabilities, and configuration needs without hardcoding them.

An alternative would be a single-file approach for simple agents, but the directory-per-agent model is more scalable, allowing agents to have their own dependencies, resources, or complex logic spread across multiple files in the future.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
None. Agent discovery will be file-system-based.

### API Design
No new public-facing API endpoints are required. An internal agent discovery mechanism (e.g., a function `discover_agents()` in a future `agent_manager.py`) will scan the `agents` directory.

### Frontend Components
N/A. This is a backend/CLI-focused feature.

### Backend Services
No new running services are needed for this task. The implementation consists of creating files and directories. A future `AgentManager` service will be responsible for utilizing this structure.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Interface Rigidity**: Defining an agent interface now might make it hard to change later.
  - **Mitigation**: Keep the initial interface minimal. The example agent will implement a simple `run(context: dict) -> str` method, which is generic enough to evolve. The manifest can be used to declare more specific needs.

### Business Risks
- **Developer Experience**: If the structure is confusing, developers won't extend the system.
  - **Mitigation**: The example agent must be extremely simple and well-documented with inline comments. The `README.md` should be updated with a section on creating agents.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: 0.5 days
**Dependencies**: None
**Priority**: High
**Category**: feature

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Files to create**:
    1. `agents/example_agent/agent.py`
    2. `agents/example_agent/manifest.json`
- **Directories to create**:
    1. `agents/`
    2. `agents/example_agent/`
- **Key classes/functions to implement**:
    - In `agent.py`, create a class `ExampleAgent` with a method `def run(self, task_description: str) -> str:`. The method should simply return a string like `f"ExampleAgent received: {task_description}"`.
- **CLI command structure**: N/A for this task.
- **Acceptance criteria**: See below.

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
**IN SCOPE**:
- Creating the `agents` directory.
- Creating the `agents/example_agent` subdirectory.
- Creating a simple `agent.py` file with a placeholder class and method.
- Creating a `manifest.json` file with basic metadata (`name`, `description`, `version`).

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- The agent runner or manager that discovers and executes agents.
- Any mechanism to install agent dependencies.
- A CLI command to create new agents from a template.
- Updating the main `README.md` (can be a follow-up task).

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] The `agents` directory exists at the project root.
- [ ] The `agents/example_agent` directory exists inside `agents`.
- [ ] The `agents/example_agent/agent.py` file exists and contains the `ExampleAgent` class with a `run` method.
- [ ] The `agents/example_agent/manifest.json` file exists, is valid JSON, and contains `name`, `description`, and `version` keys.
