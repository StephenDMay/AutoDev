# FEATURE: User Dashboard with Charts and Analytics

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature introduces a user-facing dashboard to visualize key data through charts and analytics. It will provide users with insights into their activity and system performance, improving user engagement and data visibility by leveraging the existing template-based generation system.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The implementation of a new dashboard will touch several parts of the Loom system and require careful integration with the target project's existing codebase.

**Relevant Loom Components:**
*   **`templates/ui.py`**: This is the primary entry point for generating UI-related features and will be the starting point for the dashboard.
*   **`templates/api.py` & `templates/data.py`**: These templates will be used to generate the necessary backend APIs and data processing pipelines to feed the dashboard charts.
*   **`agents/project_analysis_agent/agent.py`**: This agent is critical for analyzing the target codebase. It must identify existing UI frameworks, charting libraries, and data sources to ensure the new dashboard integrates seamlessly.
*   **`core/context_manager.py`**: The analysis from the `ProjectAnalysisAgent` will be stored and accessed via the context manager.

**Target Project Integration:**
*   **Authentication**: The dashboard must integrate with the target project's authentication system. The presence of `generated-issues/20250722_085449_Add_user_authentication_with_JWT_tokens.md` suggests that JWT-based authentication is a key consideration.
*   **Existing Frontend**: The `ProjectAnalysisAgent` must determine if a frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) and charting library (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js) are already in use. The generated dashboard must conform to these existing technology choices and coding patterns.
*   **System Architecture**: The new dashboard components must fit into the target project's existing architecture without introducing significant technical debt.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
*   **User Workflow**: Currently, users lack a centralized, visual way to understand their data within the application. A dashboard addresses this pain point by providing at-a-glance insights, reducing the need to manually query data or analyze logs.
*   **Industry Patterns**: Most modern applications provide a dashboard as the main landing page after login. Common patterns include a grid-based layout with individual "widgets" for each chart or metric. Best practices emphasize clarity, relevance, and performance.
*   **Competitive Analysis**: Competing solutions often offer highly customizable and interactive dashboards. For an MVP, a non-customizable dashboard with the most critical metrics is a standard and effective approach.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is to leverage Loom's existing template-based, multi-agent architecture.

1.  The user will invoke the `ui.py` template: `python loom.py --template ui "implement user dashboard with charts and analytics"`
2.  The `ProjectAnalysisAgent` will analyze the target project to identify the frontend stack, UI component structure, and available data APIs.
3.  The `Orchestrator` will use this analysis to guide other agents in generating the required code:
    *   Generate backend code using `api.py` and `data.py` templates to create data endpoints.
    *   Generate frontend code using the `ui.py` template, creating dashboard components that match the target project's framework and style.
4.  The generated code will include placeholder components for charts that can be wired up to the new data endpoints.

An alternative approach would be to generate a standalone dashboard using a generic library, but this would be less integrated and likely violate the conventions of the target project.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
- No changes to the Loom database are required.
- The target project may require schema modifications or new tables to store aggregated data for efficient dashboard loading. This will be determined by the `ProjectAnalysisAgent`.

### API Design
- New API endpoints will be required (e.g., `/api/dashboard/analytics`, `/api/dashboard/metrics`).
- These endpoints will be read-only (`GET`) and will return data formatted for charting libraries.
- The APIs must be protected and should only return data for the authenticated user.

### Frontend Components
- **`DashboardPage.js`**: A top-level container for the dashboard layout.
- **`ChartWidget.js`**: A reusable component that takes data and configuration to render a specific chart (e.g., line, bar, pie).
- **`MetricDisplay.js`**: A component to display a single key metric (e.g., "Total Users").

### Backend Services
- **`AnalyticsService.py`**: A new service responsible for querying the database and aggregating data for the dashboard.
- **`DashboardController.py`**: A new controller to expose the `AnalyticsService` logic via the new API endpoints.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Incorrect Stack Detection**: The `ProjectAnalysisAgent` might fail to correctly identify the target project's frontend stack, leading to incompatible code generation.
  - **Mitigation**: Improve the agent's analysis heuristics and provide a manual override for the user to specify the stack.
- **Data Performance**: Backend queries for the dashboard could be slow if they operate on large, non-aggregated datasets.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement a data aggregation layer that pre-calculates metrics on a schedule.

### Business Risks
- **Low User Adoption**: The dashboard might not display the metrics users find most valuable.
  - **Mitigation**: Conduct user research or analyze usage patterns to determine the most important metrics for the MVP.
- **Poor User Experience**: If the dashboard is slow or cluttered, it will frustrate users.
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on performance and a clean, simple design for the initial release.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies**: A functional user authentication system must be in place in the target project.
**Priority**: High
**Category**: feature

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Files to Create/Modify**:
    - **Create**: `[target_project]/frontend/components/DashboardPage.js`, `[target_project]/frontend/components/ChartWidget.js`, `[target_project]/backend/services/AnalyticsService.py`, `[target_project]/backend/controllers/DashboardController.py`.
    - **Modify**: `[target_project]/frontend/routes.js` (to add the dashboard route), `[target_project]/backend/routes.py` (to add the API routes).
- **Key Functions to Implement**:
    - `get_dashboard_analytics(user_id)` in `AnalyticsService`.
    - `fetchDashboardData()` in `DashboardPage.js`.
- **CLI Command**: `python loom.py --template ui "implement user dashboard with charts and analytics"`
- **Acceptance Criteria**: The generated code must be free of linting errors and pass all existing and new unit tests.

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
**IN SCOPE**:
- A non-interactive dashboard page with 3-4 pre-defined charts and metrics.
- Backend APIs to support these charts.
- Integration with the existing authentication system.

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- User-customizable dashboards (e.g., rearranging or adding new widgets).
- Real-time data updates (data can be loaded on page load).
- Advanced filtering or date-range selection.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] A new route (`/dashboard`) is created that renders the dashboard page.
- [ ] The dashboard page displays at least three different charts populated with data from the backend.
- [ ] Access to the dashboard and its data is restricted to authenticated users.
- [ ] The generated code adheres to the target project's existing coding style and conventions.
