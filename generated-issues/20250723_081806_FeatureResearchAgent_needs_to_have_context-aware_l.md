# FEATURE: Context-Aware FeatureResearchAgent

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature will enhance the `FeatureResearchAgent` to opportunistically use available context from the `ContextManager`. This aligns with the project's architectural principle of "Opportunistic Context Discovery," allowing the agent to provide more relevant and specific research when context is available, while still functioning effectively without it.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
- **`agents/feature_research_agent/agent.py`**: This file will be modified to include context discovery logic. The `execute` method will be updated to gather context and pass it to the prompt generation process.
- **`core/context_manager.py`**: The `ContextManager` provides the `get()` method, which the `FeatureResearchAgent` will use to retrieve context. No changes are needed in this file.
- **`documentation/ArchitectualDecisions.md`**: This document outlines the "Opportunistic Context Discovery" principle that this feature will implement.
- **`documentation/TemplateDesignMvp.md`**: This document provides a clear example of how the `FeatureResearchAgent`'s template should be structured to handle context conditionally.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
- **User Workflows**: Developers using this tool will benefit from more accurate and context-specific feature research. For example, if a `ProjectAnalysisAgent` has already run, the `FeatureResearchAgent` can provide research that is tailored to the project's existing tech stack and coding patterns.
- **Industry Patterns**: The proposed change aligns with the concept of "progressive enhancement," where a system's capabilities grow as more information becomes available. This is a common pattern in modern, flexible software architectures.
- **Competitive Analysis**: Many existing development automation tools require rigid configurations and data pipelines. This feature will differentiate Loom by providing a more flexible and "intelligent" approach to context management.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is to modify the `FeatureResearchAgent` to:
1.  **Discover Available Context**: Before generating the research prompt, the agent will query the `ContextManager` for a predefined set of "potentially useful" context keys (e.g., `project_analysis_summary`, `tech_stack_info`).
2.  **Build a "Context-Rich" Prompt**: The agent will then construct a prompt that includes the discovered context. The prompt template will be designed to instruct the LLM on how to use this context effectively.
3.  **Graceful Degradation**: If no context is available, the prompt will naturally fall back to a more general research request. The intelligence is in the prompt and the LLM's ability to interpret it, not in complex conditional logic within the agent.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
No database changes are required.

### API Design
No API changes are required.

### Frontend Components
No frontend components are affected.

### Backend Services
- **`agents.feature_research_agent.agent.FeatureResearchAgent`**:
    - A new private method `_discover_available_context()` will be added to gather context from the `ContextManager`.
    - The `execute()` method will be modified to call `_discover_available_context()` and pass the context to the template.
    - The template loading and population logic will be updated to handle a dictionary of context data.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: The LLM may not correctly interpret the provided context, leading to irrelevant or poorly-structured research.
- **Mitigation**: The prompt template will include explicit instructions on how to use the context. We will also need to experiment with different LLM providers to see which ones perform best.

### Business Risks
- **Risk**: The perceived value of the "context-aware" feature may not be high enough to justify the development effort.
- **Mitigation**: The initial implementation will be minimal and focused on proving the concept. We will gather user feedback before investing in more advanced context-handling features.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours
**Dependencies**: None
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Feature

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Files to modify**: `agents/feature_research_agent/agent.py`
- **Key classes/functions to implement**:
    - `FeatureResearchAgent._discover_available_context()`: This method will be responsible for getting data from the `ContextManager`.
    - `FeatureResearchAgent.execute()`: This method will be updated to orchestrate the context discovery and prompt generation.
- **CLI command structure**: No changes to the CLI are needed.
- **Acceptance criteria**:
    - When the `ContextManager` contains `project_analysis_summary`, the `FeatureResearchAgent`'s prompt should include this summary.
    - When the `ContextManager` is empty, the `FeatureResearchAgent` should still execute successfully and generate a useful, albeit more general, research report.

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
- **IN SCOPE**:
    - Modifying the `FeatureResearchAgent` to be context-aware.
    - Updating the `feature_research_template.md` to handle context.
- **OUT OF SCOPE**:
    - Changes to any other agents.
    - Advanced context management features like context versioning or cross-agent context validation.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] The `FeatureResearchAgent` can execute successfully both with and without data in the `ContextManager`.
- [ ] The research output is noticeably more specific and relevant when context is provided.
- [ ] The implementation follows the "Opportunistic Context Discovery" principle outlined in the project's documentation.
