# FEATURE: Agent Orchestrator Analysis and Refinement

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This analysis reviews the `AgentOrchestrator`, which is responsible for dynamically loading and managing agents. The core implementation is sound, but it requires refinement to handle common directory scanning issues and improve path resolution robustness for reliable agent discovery.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The `AgentOrchestrator` is located in `agents/orchestrator.py`. It correctly identifies and loads agents from subdirectories within the `agents` folder by reading a `manifest.json` file. However, it does not currently ignore special directories like `__pycache__` or other non-agent folders, which will cause errors during the loading process. The file path resolution for the agent directory is relative, which could lead to issues depending on the execution context.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
The current plugin-based architecture is a standard and effective pattern for creating extensible systems. By defining a clear contract (`BaseAgent` abstract class) and a discovery mechanism (`manifest.json`), the system allows for modular and independent development of new agents. This approach is common in systems that require high degrees of flexibility and extensibility.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is to refine the existing `load_agents` method. The primary change will be to add a check to explicitly ignore directories that do not contain a `manifest.json`, which implicitly filters out irrelevant directories like `__pycache__`. Additionally, constructing an absolute path to the `agents` directory will prevent path resolution issues.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
No database changes are required.

### API Design
No changes to the public API of `AgentOrchestrator` are needed. The methods `list_agents`, `get_agent`, and `execute_agent` remain the same.

### Frontend Components
No frontend components are affected.

### Backend Services
The `AgentOrchestrator`'s `load_agents` method will be modified to be more resilient.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Risk 1**: Relative path issues. - **Mitigation**: Construct an absolute path to the `agents` directory based on the location of the `orchestrator.py` file itself. This ensures that the orchestrator can always find the agents directory, regardless of where the application is launched from.
- **Risk 2**: Errors from non-agent directories. - **Mitigation**: The loading logic will be updated to gracefully skip any subdirectory that does not contain a `manifest.json` file, preventing crashes when encountering irrelevant directories like `__pycache__`.

### Business Risks
- **Risk 1**: Agent loading failures could prevent the system from functioning. - **Mitigation**: By making the loading process more robust, we decrease the likelihood of the entire system failing due to a misconfigured or irrelevant directory within the `agents` folder.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: 0.5 days
**Dependencies**: None
**Priority**: High
**Category**: technical-debt

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Files to modify**: `agents/orchestrator.py`
- **Key classes/functions to implement**: Modify the `AgentOrchestrator.__init__` and `AgentOrchestrator.load_agents` methods.
- **CLI command structure**: No CLI changes.
- **Acceptance criteria**: The orchestrator must successfully load all valid agents and ignore all other directories or files in the `agents` directory.

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
**IN SCOPE**:
- Making the agent loading mechanism in `AgentOrchestrator` more robust.
- Ensuring paths are handled correctly regardless of the current working directory.

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- Adding new features to the agents themselves.
- Changing the `BaseAgent` interface.
- Implementing a file-watching mechanism to reload agents automatically.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] The `AgentOrchestrator` correctly resolves the path to the `agents` directory.
- [ ] The `AgentOrchestrator` successfully loads the `example_agent`.
- [ ] The `AgentOrchestrator` does not throw an error when encountering the `__pycache__` directory.
- [ ] The `list_agents()` method returns a list containing the name of the `example_agent`.
