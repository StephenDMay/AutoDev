# FEATURE: Update README to mention dev automation experimentation

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature involves updating the project's `README.md` file to include a brief statement about our ongoing experiments with development automation. This enhances transparency for contributors and stakeholders regarding our evolving development practices.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The `README.md` file at the root of the project is the only component affected. The change is purely informational and has no impact on the existing architecture, data models, or APIs. No technical debt will be incurred, and no architectural changes are necessary.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
It is a standard practice for `README.md` files to provide a high-level overview of a project's status and development methodologies. Informing contributors about experiments with automation sets clear expectations and can attract contributors interested in modern development practices. This is a low-effort, high-transparency change that improves project communication.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is a direct modification of the `README.md` file using a text editor or a file manipulation tool. An alternative would be to add this information to a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, but for a small, high-level note, the `README.md` is more appropriate and visible.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
None.

### API Design
None.

### Frontend Components
None.

### Backend Services
None.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Risk 1**: Introducing typos or formatting errors to the `README.md`.
  - **Mitigation**: Careful proofreading and using a markdown previewer before finalizing the change.

### Business Risks
- **Risk 1**: The term "dev automation" could be misinterpreted.
  - **Mitigation**: Use clear, concise language to describe the experiment without overstating its current scope or success.

## PROJECT DETAILS
