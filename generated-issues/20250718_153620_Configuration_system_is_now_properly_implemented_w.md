# FEATURE: Agent-Specific Configuration System

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature implements a robust, multi-layered configuration system that allows for global, agent-specific, and runtime configurations. This enables fine-grained control over individual agent behavior while maintaining a consistent base configuration, which is critical for a flexible and scalable multi-agent architecture.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
- **`core/config_manager.py`**: This file contains the core of the configuration management system.
    - `ConfigManager`: A singleton class that handles loading, validation, and access to the main `dev-automation.config.json` file. It uses a JSON schema (`core/config_schema.json`) for validation. It includes a `get_agent_config` method that correctly merges an agent's `config.json` with the base configuration.
    - `AgentConfigManager`: A wrapper class that provides an agent-specific view of the configuration. It is instantiated with a `ConfigManager` instance and an `agent_name`. It lazily loads the merged agent configuration and provides a simple `get` method for accessing configuration values.
- **`agents/orchestrator.py`**: The `AgentOrchestrator` is responsible for loading and managing agents.
    - It correctly instantiates `AgentConfigManager` for each agent, passing it to the agent's constructor. This ensures that each agent gets its own tailored configuration.
- **`dev-automation.config.json`**: This is the global configuration file. It defines project-level settings and default configurations for various components.
- **`agents/*/config.json`**: Each agent can have its own `config.json` file to override global settings or define agent-specific parameters. The `example_agent` demonstrates this.
- **`tests/core/test_config_manager.py`**: This file contains unit tests for the `ConfigManager`. The tests cover loading valid and invalid configs, schema validation, getting nested keys, and the deep merge logic. It also includes tests for `get_agent_config`, verifying that agent-specific configurations are merged correctly.

The current implementation is well-structured and appears to correctly handle the merging of global and agent-specific configurations. The use of a JSON schema for validation is a good practice.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
- **User Workflows**: Developers using this system will need to configure agents for different tasks. For example, a "code generation" agent might need a different LLM model or temperature setting than a "testing" agent. This system allows for that level of customization without duplicating configuration.
- **Industry Patterns**: The use of a hierarchical configuration system (global -> specific) is a common and effective pattern in software development. It's seen in frameworks like Spring Boot, and in infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform (with its variable precedence). The current implementation aligns with these established patterns.
- **Competitive Analysis**: Many automation and orchestration tools offer some form of configuration management. A key differentiator for this system is the deep integration with the agent-based architecture, allowing for very granular control over each component of the development lifecycle.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The current technical approach is sound. It uses a singleton pattern for the `ConfigManager` to ensure a single source of truth for the base configuration. The `AgentConfigManager` wrapper is a good use of the Decorator or Proxy pattern, simplifying configuration access for agents.

The deep merge logic in `_deep_merge` is a critical part of the implementation. It recursively merges dictionaries, which is the correct approach for hierarchical configuration.

No major architectural changes are needed for this feature as it is already well-implemented.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
The feature is already implemented. This analysis serves as a review and documentation of the existing implementation.

### Database Changes
- N/A

### API Design
- N/A

### Frontend Components
- N/A

### Backend Services
- **`ConfigManager`**:
    - `load_config(config_path)`: Loads the base configuration.
    - `get(key, default)`: Retrieves a configuration value.
    - `get_agent_config(agent_name)`: Merges and returns the configuration for a specific agent.
- **`AgentConfigManager`**:
    - `get(key, default)`: Retrieves a configuration value from the agent's merged configuration.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Configuration Complexity**: As the number of agents and configuration options grows, managing the configuration could become complex.
    - **Mitigation**: The use of a JSON schema helps to manage this complexity by enforcing a clear structure. Clear documentation for each configuration option is also essential.
- **Merge Logic Bugs**: A bug in the `_deep_merge` function could lead to incorrect configurations.
    - **Mitigation**: The existing unit tests for the merge logic are a good safeguard. These tests should be maintained and expanded if the merge logic is ever modified.

### Business Risks
- **User Confusion**: If the configuration hierarchy and precedence are not clearly documented, users may struggle to understand how to configure the system correctly.
    - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation with examples is crucial. The `README.md` or a dedicated documentation page should explain the configuration system in detail.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: 0 days (already implemented)
**Dependencies**: None
**Priority**: High (this is a core component of the system)
**Category**: Technical-debt (as this is documenting an existing feature)

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Files to create/modify**: None.
- **Key classes/functions**: `ConfigManager`, `AgentConfigManager`.
- **CLI command structure**: N/A
- **Acceptance criteria**:
    - The system loads a global configuration file.
    - The system validates the configuration against a JSON schema.
    - Each agent receives a configuration that is a deep merge of the global configuration and its own `config.json`.
    - Agent-specific settings override global settings.
    - The system is robust to missing agent configuration files.

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
- **IN SCOPE**:
    - Loading and validating a global configuration file.
    - Loading agent-specific configuration files.
    - Merging global and agent-specific configurations.
    - Providing agents with an easy way to access their configuration.
- **OUT OF SCOPE**:
    - Dynamic reloading of configuration at runtime.
    - A UI for managing configurations.
    - Environment-specific configurations (e.g., `dev`, `prod`).

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [x] The `ConfigManager` loads and validates the `dev-automation.config.json` file.
- [x] The `AgentOrchestrator` creates an `AgentConfigManager` for each agent.
- [x] The `AgentConfigManager` correctly merges the agent's `config.json` with the global config.
- [x] Unit tests in `test_config_manager.py` pass, verifying the merge logic and schema validation.
- [x] An agent can access both global and its own specific configuration values.
