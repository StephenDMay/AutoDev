# FEATURE: Allow MVP scope level analysis in the ProjectAnalysisAgent

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature enhances the `ProjectAnalysisAgent` to perform a focused analysis on files and directories relevant to the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope. This is achieved by cross-referencing the project's file structure with the features outlined in `documentation/MVP_FeatureRequests.md`. This allows for a more targeted and relevant analysis, reducing noise and focusing on the core components required for the MVP.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The `ProjectAnalysisAgent` currently scans the entire project directory, ignoring a predefined set of patterns. It identifies key files like `README.md` and `requirements.txt` to provide a general project overview. The `MVP_FeatureRequests.md` file outlines the features required for the MVP. The agent does not currently have a mechanism to focus its analysis on a specific scope, such as the MVP.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
In software development, particularly in agile environments, focusing on the MVP is a common practice. This allows for faster iteration and delivery of value. By enabling the `ProjectAnalysisAgent` to focus on the MVP scope, we align the tool with this industry best practice. This will help developers and other agents to quickly understand the most critical parts of the codebase, accelerating development and reducing cognitive load.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is to add a new method to the `ProjectAnalysisAgent` that identifies files and directories related to the MVP. This will be achieved by:
1. Reading the `documentation/MVP_FeatureRequests.md` file to extract feature names.
2. Searching the codebase for files and directories that match these feature names.
3. Modifying the `execute` method to accept an `analysis_scope` parameter, which can be set to "mvp" to trigger the focused analysis.
4. When `analysis_scope` is "mvp", the agent will prioritize the analysis of the identified MVP-related files.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
No database changes are required.

### API Design
No API changes are required.

### Frontend Components
No frontend components are required.

### Backend Services
The `ProjectAnalysisAgent` will be modified as follows:
- A new private method `_get_mvp_scope_files` will be added to identify MVP-related files.
- The `execute` method will be updated to accept an `analysis_scope` parameter.
- The `_analyze_directory_structure` and `_get_key_files_content` methods will be updated to use the list of MVP files to focus the analysis.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Risk 1**: The MVP feature names in `MVP_FeatureRequests.md` may not directly correspond to file or directory names.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement a fuzzy matching algorithm or a more sophisticated mapping mechanism to correlate features with files. For the initial implementation, a simple keyword search will be used.
- **Risk 2**: The focused analysis might miss some important files that are not explicitly mentioned in the MVP document.
  - **Mitigation**: The agent will still perform a high-level scan of the entire project, but will provide a more detailed analysis of the MVP-related files.

### Business Risks
- **Risk 1**: The MVP scope analysis may not be accurate if the `MVP_FeatureRequests.md` file is not kept up-to-date.
  - **Mitigation**: This is a process-related risk. We will document the importance of keeping the MVP document updated.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day
**Dependencies**: None
**Priority**: High
**Category**: feature

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Files to modify**: `agents/project_analysis_agent/agent.py`
- **Key classes/functions to implement**:
  - `_get_mvp_scope_files()`: New private method.
  - `execute()`: Modify to accept `analysis_scope`.
  - `_analyze_directory_structure()`: Modify to prioritize MVP files.
  - `_get_key_files_content()`: Modify to prioritize MVP files.
- **CLI command structure**: No new CLI commands are required. The `analysis_scope` will be passed programmatically.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - When `execute(analysis_scope="mvp")` is called, the agent should produce an analysis focused on the MVP scope.
  - The analysis should include a summary of the MVP features and the corresponding files.

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
**IN SCOPE**:
- Reading `documentation/MVP_FeatureRequests.md` to identify MVP features.
- Searching the codebase for files and directories related to the MVP features.
- Providing a focused analysis of the MVP scope.

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- Automatically updating the `MVP_FeatureRequests.md` file.
- Implementing a complex mapping between features and files. This will be handled by simple keyword matching in this iteration.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] The `ProjectAnalysisAgent` can be called with an `analysis_scope` of "mvp".
- [ ] The agent correctly identifies files and directories related to the MVP features.
- [ ] The analysis output is focused on the MVP scope and provides a clear overview of the relevant components.

## GITHUB ISSUE TEMPLATE
**Title**: Enhance ProjectAnalysisAgent to support MVP scope analysis
**Labels**: feature, project-analysis
**Assignee**:
**Project**: Loom

I will now proceed with the implementation. I will start by modifying the `ProjectAnalysisAgent` to include the `analysis_scope` parameter and the logic to identify MVP-related files.
