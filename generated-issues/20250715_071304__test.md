# FEATURE: AI-Powered Test Generation and Execution

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature introduces an AI-powered agent capable of automatically generating and executing unit tests for a given code file. This accelerates the development cycle, improves code quality by increasing test coverage, and helps developers identify bugs and edge cases more efficiently.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The existing architecture is built around a modular `AgentOrchestrator` that loads and runs agents from the `agents/` directory. Each agent (e.g., `issue_generator`) is self-contained with a manifest and an `agent.py` file implementing a class that inherits from `base_agent.py`.

A new `TestAgent` will be created following this pattern, residing in `agents/test_agent/`. It will integrate seamlessly with the `AgentOrchestrator` and leverage the existing `BaseAgent` interface. The agent will require the ability to read files from the user's workspace and execute shell commands (e.g., `pytest`) to run the tests it generates. The `templates/` directory could be extended to include a `test_template.py` to ensure generated tests follow a consistent structure.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
In modern software development, testing is critical but often tedious and time-consuming. Developers face challenges in writing comprehensive tests that cover all edge cases. While tools like linters and static analyzers help, they don't validate the logic's correctness under various conditions.

AI-assisted test generation is an emerging trend. Solutions like GitHub Copilot offer inline suggestions, but a dedicated testing agent provides a more powerful, automated workflow. The goal is not to replace the developer but to provide a strong baseline of tests (unit, and in the future, integration) that the developer can review and augment. This feature directly addresses the developer pain point of test creation boilerplate and helps enforce Test-Driven Development (TDD) or Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) practices.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is to implement a `TestAgent` that performs the following steps:
1.  **Receive a Task**: The agent is invoked by the orchestrator with a target file path (e.g., `src/my_module.py`).
2.  **Analyze Code**: The agent reads the content of the target file.
3.  **Generate Tests**: It sends the source code to a configured AI model (LLM) with a prompt instructing it to generate unit tests using the `pytest` framework. The prompt will include the source code and instructions to identify functions, classes, and edge cases, and to create corresponding tests.
4.  **Write Test File**: The agent saves the generated test code to a new file, following a standard naming convention (e.g., `tests/test_my_module.py`).
5.  **Execute Tests**: The agent runs `pytest` on the newly created test file using a shell command.
6.  **Report Results**: It captures the output from `pytest` (pass, fail, errors) and presents it to the user.

**Alternative Approach**: A more advanced implementation could involve two agents: a `TestGenerationAgent` and a `TestExecutionAgent`. This would separate concerns but adds complexity. For the initial implementation, a single, focused `TestAgent` is preferable.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
- None required for this feature.

### API Design
- No changes to external-facing APIs. The feature will be invoked through the existing CLI/orchestrator mechanism.

### Frontend Components
- N/A (Current system is CLI-based). Output will be formatted text in the console.

### Backend Services
- **`TestAgent`**: A new class inheriting from `BaseAgent`.
    - `execute(task)` method will contain the core logic for reading the file, calling the LLM, writing the test file, and executing `pytest`.
- **`AgentOrchestrator`**: May require minor modifications to ensure it can pass file paths or other necessary context to the selected agent.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Incorrect Test Generation**: The LLM may "hallucinate" or generate logically flawed tests.
    - **Mitigation**: The feature includes test execution as a core step. Failed tests will be reported, and the developer is expected to review the generated code.
- **Incomplete Context**: The agent might lack sufficient project context to generate meaningful tests for complex code that has many dependencies.
    - **Mitigation**: Initially, focus on unit tests for relatively simple, self-contained functions. Future enhancements can involve providing more context (e.g., imported modules) to the LLM.
- **Dependency on `pytest`**: The system will depend on the user having `pytest` installed in their environment.
    - **Mitigation**: The agent will first check if `pytest` is available and provide a clear error message to the user if it's not.

### Business Risks
- **False Sense of Security**: Users might blindly trust AI-generated tests, leading to uncaught bugs.
    - **Mitigation**: Clearly label all AI-generated code and explicitly state in the documentation and output that human review is essential.
- **Cost of LLM Calls**: Generating tests for large files could be expensive.
    - **Mitigation**: Allow users to configure the AI model used (e.g., a smaller, faster, cheaper model for drafts). Implement caching to avoid re-generating tests for unchanged code.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days
**Dependencies**: A stable `BaseAgent` and `AgentOrchestrator`. The user's environment must have Python and `pytest` installed.
**Priority**: High
**Category**: feature

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Files to Create**:
    - `agents/test_agent/manifest.json`
    - `agents/test_agent/agent.py`
    - (Optional) `templates/test_template.py`
- **Key Classes/Functions**:
    - `class TestAgent(BaseAgent)` in `agent.py`.
    - `def execute(self, task: str)`: The main entry point for the agent.
- **CLI Command Structure**:
    - `python dev-issue.py --task "Generate tests for path/to/file.py"`
    - The orchestrator would route this to a "planning" agent first, which would then delegate the specific file-testing task to the `TestAgent`.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: See below.

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
**IN SCOPE**:
- Generating `pytest` unit tests for a single specified Python file.
- Creating a new test file (e.g., `test_*.py`).
- Executing the generated tests using `pytest`.
- Reporting a summary of the test results (pass/fail/error) to the CLI.

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- Generating integration, end-to-end, or performance tests.
- Testing files in languages other than Python.
- Modifying existing test files (the agent will always create a new one).
- Automatic test remediation or code fixing based on test results.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] A new agent named `TestAgent` is available in the `agents` directory with a valid manifest.
- [ ] When given the path to a Python file, the agent successfully generates a corresponding `test_*.py` file.
- [ ] The generated test file contains valid `pytest` syntax.
- [ ] The agent executes `pytest` on the new test file and captures the results.
- [ ] The final output to the user clearly indicates whether the tests passed or failed.
- [ ] If `pytest` is not installed, the agent reports a clear error and instructions.
