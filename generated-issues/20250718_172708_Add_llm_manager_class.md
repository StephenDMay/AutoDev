# FEATURE: LLM Manager Class

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature introduces a centralized `LLMManager` class to handle all interactions with large language models (LLMs). This will standardize how agents access LLMs, simplify configuration, and make it easier to add new models and providers in the future.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
Currently, each agent is responsible for its own LLM interaction, leading to duplicated code and inconsistent implementation. The `AgentOrchestrator` loads agents and their configurations, but there is no shared mechanism for accessing LLMs. The `ConfigManager` provides a way to manage configuration, but it doesn't enforce any structure on how LLM settings are stored.

The `LLMManager` will be a new class that is instantiated in the `AgentOrchestrator` and passed to each agent. This will require a small modification to the `BaseAgent` class to accept the `LLMManager` instance.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
In multi-agent systems, it is a common pattern to have a centralized service for accessing external resources like LLMs. This promotes loose coupling and makes the system more modular and extensible. It also simplifies monitoring and cost tracking, which are key constraints for this project. By abstracting away the specifics of each LLM API, we can create a more resilient and maintainable system.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
I will create a new `LLMManager` class in a new file `core/llm_manager.py`. This class will be responsible for loading LLM configurations from the `ConfigManager` and providing a simple interface for agents to make LLM calls.

The `LLMManager` will be initialized in the `AgentOrchestrator` and passed to each agent upon initialization. The `BaseAgent` will be updated to accept the `LLMManager` in its constructor.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
No database changes are required for this feature.

### API Design
No external API changes are required. The internal API will be the new `LLMManager` class.

### Frontend Components
No frontend components are affected by this change.

### Backend Services
- **`core/llm_manager.py`**: A new file containing the `LLMManager` class.
- **`agents/orchestrator.py`**: The `AgentOrchestrator` will be modified to initialize the `LLMManager` and pass it to the agents.
- **`agents/base_agent.py`**: The `BaseAgent` will be modified to accept the `LLMManager` in its constructor.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Breaking Changes**: Modifying the `BaseAgent` constructor is a breaking change that will require updating all existing agents.
  - **Mitigation**: Since the project is in its early stages, this is an acceptable risk. I will update the `example_agent` as part of this change.
- **Configuration Complexity**: The LLM configuration might become complex.
  - **Mitigation**: I will create a clear schema for the LLM configuration in `core/config_schema.json` and provide good documentation.

### Business Risks
- **Performance Degradation**: A centralized LLM manager could become a bottleneck.
  - **Mitigation**: The `LLMManager` will be designed to be stateless and will not hold any long-lived connections to the LLM providers. This will minimize the risk of it becoming a bottleneck.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day
**Dependencies**: None
**Priority**: High
**Category**: feature

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Create `core/llm_manager.py`**: This file will contain the `LLMManager` class.
- **Modify `core/config_schema.json`**: Add a new section for `llm_providers`.
- **Modify `agents/orchestrator.py`**: Instantiate `LLMManager` and pass it to agents.
- **Modify `agents/base_agent.py`**: Update the constructor to accept `llm_manager`.
- **Modify `agents/example_agent/agent.py`**: Update the agent to use the `LLMManager`.

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
**IN SCOPE**:
- Creating the `LLMManager` class.
- Integrating the `LLMManager` with the `AgentOrchestrator` and `BaseAgent`.
- Updating the `example_agent` to use the `LLMManager`.
- Defining a configuration schema for LLM providers.

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- Implementing support for specific LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic). This will be done in separate features.
- Adding advanced features like caching and rate limiting to the `LLMManager`.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] `LLMManager` class is created in `core/llm_manager.py`.
- [ ] `LLMManager` is initialized in `AgentOrchestrator` and passed to agents.
- [ ] `BaseAgent` constructor is updated to accept `llm_manager`.
- [ ] `example_agent` is updated to use the `LLMManager`.
- [ ] The application runs successfully with the new changes.

## GITHUB ISSUE TEMPLATE
