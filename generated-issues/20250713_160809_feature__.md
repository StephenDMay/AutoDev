I have received the meta-prompt template. It seems the next step is to use it to analyze a specific feature for the competitive Pokemon TCG platform.

However, the feature name provided is simply "feature," which is too generic for a detailed analysis.

Could you please provide a more specific feature name or a description of the feature you'd like me to analyze? For example:

*   "Real-time meta-game win-rate tracker"
*   "Personalized deck recommendation engine"
*   "Tournament performance analytics dashboard"
