# FEATURE: Add Configuration Validation System

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature introduces a robust configuration validation system to the `ConfigManager` using JSON Schema. It will ensure that all loaded configurations adhere to a predefined structure, validate specific values like LLM provider names, and provide helpful error messages for common configuration issues, improving system reliability and user experience.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The `core/config_manager.py` currently handles loading, retrieving, and merging JSON configurations. It includes basic error handling for file not found and malformed JSON. However, there is no validation of the *content* or *structure* of the configuration beyond basic JSON parsing. The `_config` attribute stores the loaded configuration. Integration points will be within the `load_config` and `get_merged_config` methods to apply validation immediately after loading/merging. No significant architectural changes are required, but the `ConfigManager` will gain a new responsibility.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
Users currently face issues where incorrect configuration values lead to silent failures or hard-to-debug runtime errors. Implementing a validation system will provide immediate feedback on configuration problems, reducing developer frustration and improving the system's robustness. Industry best practices strongly advocate for schema-based validation for configuration files, with JSON Schema being a widely adopted standard. This enhances maintainability, clarity, and error prevention. Performance-wise, validation should be quick, and UX should focus on clear, actionable error messages.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is to leverage the `jsonschema` Python library for validating configuration against a defined JSON Schema. A schema file (e.g., `config_schema.json`) will define the expected structure, data types, and constraints for the `dev-automation.config.json`. A new `validate_config` method will be added to `ConfigManager` to perform this validation. This method will be called after the base configuration is loaded and after any agent-specific override configurations are merged. LLM provider names will be validated against a predefined enum in the schema or a dynamic list of supported providers.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
None. Configuration is file-based.

### API Design
No new external API endpoints. Internal API changes to `ConfigManager`:
- Add a new private method `_validate_config(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> None` that raises a `ConfigValidationError` (new custom exception) if validation fails.
- Modify `load_config` to call `_validate_config` after successfully loading the base config.
- Modify `get_merged_config` to call `_validate_config` on the *merged* configuration before returning it.

### Frontend Components
N/A (CLI application).

### Backend Services
- **`core/config_manager.py`**:
    - Import `jsonschema` library.
    - Define a custom exception `ConfigValidationError` for validation failures.
    - Implement `_validate_config` method:
        - Load the JSON schema from a dedicated file (e.g., `core/config_schema.json`).
        - Use `jsonschema.validate(instance=config, schema=self._schema)` to perform validation.
        - Catch `jsonschema.ValidationError` and re-raise as `ConfigValidationError` with a more user-friendly message.
    - Update `load_config` and `get_merged_config` to call `_validate_config`.
- **New file: `core/config_schema.json`**:
    - Define the JSON schema for `dev-automation.config.json`, including:
        - Required properties (e.g., `project`, `github`, `llm_settings`).
        - Data types for each property.
        - Specific constraints (e.g., `llm_settings.default_provider` should be an enum of supported LLM providers).
        - Potentially use `additionalProperties: false` to prevent unknown top-level keys.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Schema Complexity**: As the configuration grows, maintaining the JSON schema can become complex.
    - **Mitigation**: Keep the schema modular and well-documented. Use clear descriptions and examples within the schema.
- **Dependency Introduction**: Adding `jsonschema` introduces a new dependency.
    - **Mitigation**: Ensure `jsonschema` is added to `requirements.txt`. It's a widely used and stable library.
- **Performance Overhead**: Validation could add a slight overhead during config loading.
    - **Mitigation**: JSON Schema validation is generally fast for typical configuration sizes. Profile if performance becomes an issue.
- **Error Message Clarity**: Default `jsonschema` error messages can be verbose.
    - **Mitigation**: Wrap `jsonschema.ValidationError` in a custom exception and format the error message to be more concise and actionable for the user.

### Business Risks
- **Breaking Changes**: Introducing strict validation might break existing configurations that were previously "working" but technically malformed.
    - **Mitigation**: Communicate this change clearly to users. Provide guidance on updating existing configurations. Implement this feature in a way that allows for a graceful rollout (e.g., initially log warnings instead of raising errors, then switch to errors).
- **User Frustration**: Overly strict validation or unclear error messages could frustrate users.
    - **Mitigation**: Prioritize clear, helpful error messages. Allow for some flexibility where appropriate (e.g., `additionalProperties` for future-proofing).

    - `requirements.txt` (modify)
- **Key classes/functions to implement**:
    - `ConfigValidationError` (new custom exception in `core/config_manager.py`)

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
**IN scope**:
- JSON Schema validation for the main `dev-automation.config.json` structure.
- Validation of LLM provider names against a predefined list (e.g., "gemini", "openai").
- Custom, helpful error messages for validation failures.
- Integration of validation into `load_config` and `get_merged_config`.
- Unit tests for the validation logic.

**OUT of scope**:
- Dynamic schema generation based on agent manifests.
- Runtime validation of configuration values that are not part of the initial load (e.g., values set via `set` method after initial load).
- Complex conditional validation rules that go beyond standard JSON Schema capabilities.
- UI for configuration editing or validation feedback (as this is a CLI tool).

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- [X] A `core/config_schema.json` file exists and accurately defines the expected structure of `dev-automation.config.json`.
- [X] A `ConfigValidationError` custom exception is defined in `core/config_manager.py`.
- [X] The `ConfigManager` has a private `_validate_config` method that takes a config dictionary and raises `ConfigValidationError` on invalid input.
- [X] `load_config` calls `_validate_config` after successfully loading the base configuration.
- [X] `get_merged_config` calls `_validate_config` on the *merged* configuration before returning it.

- [X] Error messages for validation failures are clear, concise, and actionable.
- [X] Unit tests cover successful validation and various failure scenarios (missing required fields, wrong data types, invalid LLM provider).
- [X] Running the system with a valid `dev-automation.config.json` proceeds without validation errors.
- [X] Running the system with an invalid `dev-automation.config.json` (e.g., missing a required field, invalid LLM provider) raises a `ConfigValidationError` with a helpful message.
