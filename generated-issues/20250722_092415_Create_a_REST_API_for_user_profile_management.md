# FEATURE: Create a REST API for user profile management

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature introduces a RESTful API for managing user profiles, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting users. This is a foundational feature that will enable user-specific functionality and data storage in the future.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The existing codebase is a CLI application with no web server or database. The `ConfigManager` can be used for API configuration, but a new web framework and database will need to be added. The `ContextManager` is not suitable for persistent user data.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
User profile management is a standard feature in most applications. The API should follow standard RESTful conventions. For this initial implementation, we'll focus on basic CRUD operations. More advanced features like password hashing and authentication can be added later.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
I recommend using the **FastAPI** web framework due to its high performance, ease of use, and automatic OpenAPI documentation generation. For the database, I'll use **SQLite** as it's a simple, file-based database that's easy to set up and use for this initial implementation.

**Alternatives:**
*   **Flask:** A more lightweight framework, but requires more boilerplate for features like data validation.
*   **PostgreSQL:** A more powerful database, but requires a separate server and more complex setup.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
A new `users` table will be created with the following schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT NOT-NULL UNIQUE,
    email TEXT NOT-NULL UNIQUE,
    full_name TEXT
);
```

### API Design
The following endpoints will be created under the `/users` path:

*   **`POST /users`**: Create a new user.
*   **`GET /users/{user_id}`**: Retrieve a user by ID.
*   **`PUT /users/{user_id}`**: Update a user's profile.
*   **`DELETE /users/{user_id}`**: Delete a user.

### Frontend Components
No frontend components will be created as part of this feature.

### Backend Services
A new `api` directory will be created to house the FastAPI application. This will include:
*   `main.py`: The main FastAPI application file.
*   `database.py`: Database connection and session management.
*   `models.py`: SQLAlchemy models for the `users` table.
*   `schemas.py`: Pydantic schemas for request and response validation.
*   `crud.py`: Functions for interacting with the database.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Introducing new dependencies (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, etc.)**: This adds complexity to the project.
  - **Mitigation**: We will add a `requirements.txt` file to manage these new dependencies.
- **Database migrations**: As the schema evolves, we will need a way to manage database migrations.
  - **Mitigation**: For this initial implementation, we will not need migrations. However, as the project grows, we can introduce a tool like Alembic.

### Business Risks
- **Security**: The initial implementation will not include authentication or authorization.
  - **Mitigation**: This will be clearly documented, and a follow-up feature for authentication will be prioritized.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: 2 days
**Dependencies**: None
**Priority**: High
**Category**: feature

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Files to create:**
    - `api/main.py`
    - `api/database.py`
    - `api/models.py`
    - `api/schemas.py`
    - `api/crud.py`
- **Key classes/functions to implement:**
    - `User` model in `models.py`
    - `UserCreate`, `UserUpdate`, and `User` schemas in `schemas.py`
    - CRUD functions in `crud.py`
    - API endpoints in `main.py`
- **CLI command to run the API:**
    - `uvicorn api.main:app --reload`
- **Acceptance criteria for "done":**
    - All API endpoints are implemented and tested.
    - The API is documented with OpenAPI.

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
**IN SCOPE:**
*   Basic CRUD operations for user profiles.
*   SQLite database integration.
*   OpenAPI documentation.

**OUT OF SCOPE:**
*   User authentication and authorization.
*   Password hashing.
*   Advanced user profile features (e.g., profile pictures).

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] A user can be created with a unique username and email.
- [ ] A user's profile can be retrieved by their ID.
- [ ] A user's profile can be updated.
- [ ] A user can be deleted.
- [ ] The API is documented at `/docs`.

## GITHUB ISSUE TEMPLATE
**Title**: Feature: Create a REST API for user profile management
**Labels**: feature, api
**Assignee**:
**Project**:

I will now proceed with the implementation. I'll start by creating the new `api` directory and the necessary files. I will also update the `requirements.txt` file.
