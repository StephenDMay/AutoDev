# FEATURE: AgentOrchestrator for Dynamic Agent Loading and Execution

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature introduces an `AgentOrchestrator` class responsible for discovering, loading, and executing agents from the `agents` directory. This provides a centralized, scalable mechanism for managing different AI agents, simplifying the process of adding new capabilities and running automated development tasks.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The current architecture includes a `base_agent.py` defining an abstract `BaseAgent` class and an `example_agent` directory showing a sample implementation. The system lacks a central component to manage these agents. The `AgentOrchestrator` will fill this gap by scanning the `agents` directory for valid agent manifests (`manifest.json`), loading them as Python modules, and providing a unified interface to execute them.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
In automated development systems, a key user workflow is the ability to easily extend the system with new tools and agents. Users (developers) need a simple, convention-based way to add their own agents without modifying the core orchestration logic. An orchestrator that dynamically loads agents based on a directory structure and a manifest file is a common and effective pattern (e.g., plugin systems in IDEs, workflow engines). This approach avoids hardcoding agent paths and simplifies agent management.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is to implement a Python class, `AgentOrchestrator`, that will:
1.  Scan the `agents` directory for subdirectories.
2.  In each subdirectory, look for a `manifest.json` file. This file will contain metadata about the agent, including the entry point (e.g., `agent.py`).
3.  Dynamically import the agent's main file as a Python module.
4.  Instantiate the agent class (which must be a subclass of `BaseAgent`).
5.  Keep a registry of loaded agents.
6.  Provide a method `execute_agent(agent_name, task)` to run a specific agent's `execute` method.

An alternative would be to use a configuration file that explicitly lists all available agents. However, the dynamic discovery approach is more flexible and requires less manual configuration as new agents are added.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
None. This feature is stateless and does not require database modifications.

### API Design
The `AgentOrchestrator` will expose a Python API, not a web API.
- `__init__(self, agent_dir='agents')`: Initializes the orchestrator and loads all agents.
- `load_agents(self)`: Scans the agent directory, validates, and loads all agents.
- `list_agents(self)`: Returns a list of loaded agent names.
- `get_agent(self, name)`: Retrieves a loaded agent instance.
- `execute_agent(self, name, task)`: Executes the specified agent with a given task.

### Frontend Components
None. This is a backend/CLI-focused feature.

### Backend Services
- **`AgentOrchestrator` class**: The core component to be built. It will reside in a new file, `agents/orchestrator.py`.
- **`BaseAgent` modification**: The `BaseAgent` in `agents/base_agent.py` will remain the abstract base class that all agents must implement.
- **Manifest File (`manifest.json`)**: A JSON file in each agent's directory will define its properties.
    ```json
    {
      "name": "ExampleAgent",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "description": "A sample agent implementation.",
      "entry_point": "agent.py",
      "class_name": "ExampleAgent"
    }
    ```

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Dynamic Import Complexity**: Dynamically loading modules can be fragile. **Mitigation**: Use Python's `importlib` library and wrap loading logic in robust `try...except` blocks to handle missing files, syntax errors, or incorrect class names gracefully.
- **Agent State Conflicts**: If agents are not designed to be stateless, running them concurrently could cause issues. **Mitigation**:  Stateless agents, sequential execution, with caching between stages.

### Business Risks
- **Poor User Experience**: If loading or execution errors are not reported clearly, it will be difficult for developers to debug their custom agents. **Mitigation**: Implement verbose logging and clear error messages that guide the user to the source of the problem (e.g., "Failed to load agent 'X': manifest.json not found").

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day
**Dependencies**: `BaseAgent` class must be defined.
**Priority**: High
**Category**: feature

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Files to create**:
    - `agents/orchestrator.py`
- **Files to modify**:
    - `agents/example_agent/manifest.json` (to ensure it's up-to-date)
- **Key classes/functions to implement**:
    - `agents.orchestrator.AgentOrchestrator`
- **CLI command structure**:
    - While this feature doesn't create the final CLI, it enables it. The intended use would be via a script:
      ```python
      from agents.orchestrator import AgentOrchestrator

      orchestrator = AgentOrchestrator()
      print("Available agents:", orchestrator.list_agents())
      result = orchestrator.execute_agent("ExampleAgent", "Do something")
      print(result)
      ```

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
**IN SCOPE**:
- Creating the `AgentOrchestrator` class.
- Implementing agent discovery based on directory structure and `manifest.json`.
- Implementing agent loading and execution.
- Basic error handling for loading and execution.

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- A user-facing CLI to interact with the orchestrator.
- Concurrent agent execution.
- Inter-agent communication.
- Managing Python dependencies for individual agents.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] `AgentOrchestrator` class is created in `agents/orchestrator.py`.
- [ ] The orchestrator can successfully discover and load the `ExampleAgent` from the `agents/example_agent` directory.
- [ ] Calling `execute_agent('ExampleAgent', 'test task')` runs the `execute` method of the `ExampleAgent` and returns its result.
- [ ] The system handles errors gracefully if an agent directory is missing a `manifest.json` or the specified entry point/class cannot be found.
- [ ] The `list_agents()` method returns a list containing the names of all successfully loaded agents.
