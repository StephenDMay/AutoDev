# FEATURE: Create basic ContextManager class

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature introduces a `ContextManager` class responsible for managing and providing access to shared state and data across different agents in the system. This is a foundational step towards enabling more complex inter-agent communication and collaborative workflows.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The current architecture has a `ConfigManager` for static configuration and an `LLMManager` for model interactions. Agents are loaded and executed by the `AgentOrchestrator`. There is no formal mechanism for agents to share contextual information beyond passing simple string outputs from one to the next. The `ContextManager` will fill this gap, acting as a centralized repository for runtime data. It will be instantiated in the `AgentOrchestrator` and passed to each agent, similar to how the `LLMManager` is handled.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
In multi-agent systems, a shared context or "blackboard" is a common pattern. This allows agents to operate on a common pool of information, enabling them to build upon each other's work without being tightly coupled. This approach is flexible and scalable, allowing for the addition of new agents and new types of contextual information without requiring changes to existing agents.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is to create a new `ContextManager` class in the `core` directory. This class will use a simple dictionary to store context data. It will provide methods to get, set, and update context. The `AgentOrchestrator` will be updated to create an instance of the `ContextManager` and pass it to each agent during initialization. `BaseAgent` will be updated to accept and store the `ContextManager` instance.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
None.

### API Design
None.

### Frontend Components
None.

### Backend Services
- **`core/context_manager.py`**: New file containing the `ContextManager` class.
- **`agents/orchestrator.py`**:
    - Instantiate `ContextManager`.
    - Pass the `ContextManager` instance to each agent upon initialization.
- **`agents/base_agent.py`**:
    - Update the `__init__` method to accept a `context_manager` argument.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Initial Complexity**: Introducing a new core component adds complexity.
    - **Mitigation**: Start with a very simple implementation (a dictionary wrapper) and add features as needed.
- **Concurrent Access**: In the future, concurrent access to the context could lead to race conditions.
    - **Mitigation**: For now, agent execution is sequential, so this is not a risk. If concurrent execution is introduced later, locking mechanisms will be required.

### Business Risks
- **Over-engineering**: Building a too-complex context management system before it's needed.
    - **Mitigation**: Keep the initial implementation minimal and focused on the immediate need of sharing simple data.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day
**Dependencies**: None
**Priority**: High
**Category**: feature

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Create `core/context_manager.py`**:
    - Implement `ContextManager` class with `__init__`, `get`, `set`, and `update` methods.
- **Modify `agents/base_agent.py`**:
    - Add `context_manager: Optional['ContextManager'] = None` to the `__init__` method.
    - Store it as `self.context_manager`.
- **Modify `agents/orchestrator.py`**:
    - In `__init__`, create `self.context_manager = ContextManager()`.
    - In `load_agents`, pass `context_manager=self.context_manager` to the agent constructor.

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
**IN SCOPE**:
- Creating the `ContextManager` class.
- Integrating the `ContextManager` into the `AgentOrchestrator` and `BaseAgent`.
- Making the `ContextManager` available to all agents.

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- Implementing any specific context-aware logic within agents.
- Persisting context between runs.
- Handling concurrent access to the context.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] A `ContextManager` class exists in `core/context_manager.py`.
- [ ] The `AgentOrchestrator` creates an instance of `ContextManager`.
- [ ] The `BaseAgent` class is updated to receive and store the `ContextManager` instance.
- [ ] Each agent loaded by the `AgentOrchestrator` has access to the same `ContextManager` instance.
