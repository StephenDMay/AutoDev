# FEATURE: ProjectAnalysisAgent Class Structure

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature introduces the `ProjectAnalysisAgent`, a specialized agent responsible for analyzing the codebase of the current project. It will provide a high-level overview of the project structure, key components, and their interactions, which will be stored in the `ContextManager` for other agents to use.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The current architecture provides a solid foundation for adding a new agent. The `ProjectAnalysisAgent` will be implemented by inheriting from `agents.base_agent.BaseAgent` and will be integrated into the system via the `agents.orchestrator.AgentOrchestrator`. It will leverage the existing `core.llm_manager.LLMManager` for its analytical capabilities and the `core.context_manager.ContextManager` to store its findings. The `core.config_manager.ConfigManager` will be used for any agent-specific configuration.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
In automated software development workflows, it's crucial to have an initial understanding of the project's structure. This "project analysis" step allows subsequent agents to have context about the codebase they are working with. This is a common pattern in AI-powered developer tools. The `ProjectAnalysisAgent` will fulfill this need by performing an initial scan and analysis of the project.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is to create a new `ProjectAnalysisAgent` class in its own directory within the `agents` folder, following the existing structure of `example_agent` and `issue_generator`. This agent will:
1.  Use `os.walk` or a similar method to traverse the project directory.
2.  Filter out irrelevant files and directories (e.g., `__pycache__`, `.git`, `node_modules`).
3.  Construct a text-based representation of the project structure.
4.  Use the `LLMManager` to analyze this structure and generate a summary.
5.  Store the summary in the `ContextManager` under a well-defined key (e.g., `project_analysis_summary`).

An alternative approach would be to use a more sophisticated code analysis tool or library (e.g., `ast` for Python) to build a more detailed representation of the code. However, for the initial implementation, a file-based summary is sufficient and more flexible.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
No database changes are required for this feature.

### API Design
No new API endpoints are required.

### Frontend Components
No frontend components are required.

### Backend Services
A new `ProjectAnalysisAgent` class will be created.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Risk 1**: The project analysis might be too slow for very large projects.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement intelligent filtering and summarization to keep the input to the LLM at a reasonable size. The agent can also be configured to only run on demand.
- **Risk 2**: The LLM-generated summary might be inaccurate or incomplete.
  - **Mitigation**: The prompt for the LLM will be carefully engineered to produce the most accurate and relevant summary. The summary will be treated as a high-level overview, not a definitive source of truth.

### Business Risks
- **Risk 1**: The analysis might not be useful for all types of projects.
  - **Mitigation**: The agent will be designed to be configurable, allowing users to tailor the analysis to their specific needs.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day
**Dependencies**: None
**Priority**: High
**Category**: feature

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Files to create**:
    - `agents/project_analysis_agent/agent.py`
    - `agents/project_analysis_agent/manifest.json`
    - `agents/project_analysis_agent/config.json`
- **Key classes/functions to implement**:
    - `ProjectAnalysisAgent(BaseAgent)`
        - `execute(self, *args, **kwargs)`: The main method that performs the project analysis.
- **Exact CLI command structure**:
    - The agent will be executed via the orchestrator. No direct CLI command is needed.
- **Clear acceptance criteria for "done"**:
    - The `ProjectAnalysisAgent` is created and integrated into the orchestrator.
    - When executed, the agent analyzes the project structure, generates a summary, and stores it in the `ContextManager`.

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
**IN SCOPE**:
- Creating the `ProjectAnalysisAgent` class.
- Implementing the logic to traverse the project directory and generate a text-based representation of the project structure.
- Using the `LLMManager` to generate a summary of the project structure.
- Storing the summary in the `ContextManager`.

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- Advanced code analysis (e.g., AST parsing).
- Visualizing the project structure.
- Any UI components for displaying the analysis.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] A new `ProjectAnalysisAgent` class is created in `agents/project_analysis_agent/agent.py`.
- [ ] The agent inherits from `BaseAgent`.
- [ ] The agent uses the `LLMManager` to generate a project summary.
- [ ] The agent stores the summary in the `ContextManager`.
- [ ] The agent has a `manifest.json` and a default `config.json`.
- [ ] The agent can be successfully loaded and executed by the `AgentOrchestrator`.
