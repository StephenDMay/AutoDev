# FEATURE: Post-Rebrand System Verification

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature establishes a comprehensive testing and verification process to ensure a successful project rebrand. It guarantees that all user-facing and internal components consistently reflect the new brand identity, preventing user confusion and maintaining system functionality.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
A rebrand from the original name ("Loom") will impact numerous files across the repository. A verification process must audit all file types for remnants of the old brand.
- **Core Logic (`agents/`, `core/`, `loom.py`)**: Python files may contain the old brand name in comments, strings, or variable names. Existing business logic must remain unaffected.
- **Configuration (`*.json`)**: `dev-automation.config.json` and agent-specific `config.json` files may contain brand-specific keys or values that need checking.
- **Documentation (`documentation/`, `README.md`)**: All markdown files are heavily impacted and are the most user-facing reflection of the brand. They must be updated thoroughly.
- **Testing (`tests/`)**: Existing tests need to be reviewed and potentially updated to reflect rebranded commands, outputs, or configuration. New tests are required to automate the verification of the rebrand itself.
- **Generated Outputs (`generated-issues/`)**: The process that generates these files may embed the brand name, requiring verification.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
For developer tools, a rebrand's success hinges on clarity and consistency. Developers expect tools to be predictable. Any lingering artifacts from a previous brand name can erode trust and suggest a lack of attention to detail.
- **User Workflow**: The primary developer workflow (e.g., `python loom.py <args>`) should not be functionally broken. If commands are renamed as part of the rebrand, the changes must be tested and documented.
- **Industry Best Practice**: A common pattern is to create an automated check within the CI/CD pipeline that scans for forbidden terms (i.e., the old brand name). This prevents accidental re-introduction of the old brand. Manual review of documentation and key user journeys is also standard.
- **Competitive Analysis**: N/A for a testing feature, but successful rebrands in the open-source tool space are often accompanied by clear release notes and updated documentation, which this testing process aims to validate.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The recommended approach is a combination of automated scanning and targeted functional testing, integrated into the existing test framework.
1.  **Automated Brand Name Scan**: Create a new test suite (`tests/test_rebrand.py`) that recursively scans the entire project directory (excluding specified binary/git files) for any occurrence of the old brand name ("Loom"). This test will fail if any instances are found, ensuring no legacy branding slips through.
2.  **Functional Test Review**: Update existing unit and integration tests in the `tests/` directory to align with any name changes in classes, functions, or configuration.
3.  **CLI Command Testing**: If CLI commands are altered, add tests to verify the new command structure and ensure old commands are either gracefully handled (with deprecation warnings) or removed.
4.  **Documentation Review Checklist**: Create a manual checklist for a human reviewer to verify that all documentation (`.md` files) is contextually correct, logos/images are updated, and the tone reflects the new brand.

An alternative approach would be to rely solely on manual testing, but this is error-prone, not repeatable, and fails to prevent future regressions.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
No database changes are required for this feature.

### API Design
No new API endpoints are required. Existing API responses (if any) should be checked for the old brand name by the automated scan.

### Frontend Components
No frontend components are directly involved.

### Backend Services
- **New Test Service (`tests/test_rebrand.py`)**:
    - A new test file dedicated to brand verification.
    - It will contain a test function that walks the project directory, reads text-based files (`.py`, `.md`, `.json`, etc.), and asserts that the old brand name is not present.
- **Test Framework Integration**:
    - The new test suite will be executed alongside existing `pytest` tests.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Incomplete Scan Coverage**: The brand name scanner might miss certain file types or edge cases (e.g., brand name in a compiled file).
  - **Mitigation**: The script will target a wide range of text-based extensions and will be reviewed to ensure broad coverage. The manual documentation review provides a second layer of defense.
- **False Positives**: The scanner might flag legitimate uses of the old term if it's a common word.
  - **Mitigation**: The brand name "Loom" is reasonably unique, minimizing this risk. An ignore-list can be added to the scanner if necessary.

### Business Risks
- **Inconsistent User Experience**: If the tests fail to catch all instances of the old brand, users may see a mix of old and new branding, causing confusion.
  - **Mitigation**: A combination of automated scanning and a manual review checklist makes the verification process robust.
- **Delayed Rebrand Launch**: If the tests are too strict or flaky, they could block the release.
  - **Mitigation**: The tests will be developed and stabilized on a feature branch before being merged as a release blocker.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: 2 days
**Dependencies**: The core rebranding effort (code and documentation changes) should be mostly complete.
**Priority**: High
**Category**: enhancement

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Files to Create**:
    - `tests/test_rebrand.py`
- **Files to Modify**:
    - Potentially any file in `tests/` if class/function names have changed.
    - `.gitignore` to ensure test artifacts are not committed.
- **Key Functions to Implement**:
    - `def test_no_legacy_brand_name_in_codebase():` in `tests/test_rebrand.py`. This function will:
        1. Define a list of forbidden terms (e.g., `['Loom']`).
        2. Define a list of file extensions to scan (e.g., `.py`, `.md`, `.json`).
        3. Use `os.walk()` to traverse the project directory.
        4. For each matching file, read its content and search for any of the forbidden terms.
        5. Collect all occurrences and their file paths/line numbers.
        6. Assert that the list of occurrences is empty, providing a detailed error message if it's not.
- **CLI Command Structure**: The feature is executed via the test runner: `pytest tests/test_rebrand.py`

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
**IN SCOPE**:
- Creating an automated test to scan the codebase for the old brand name.
- Creating a manual test checklist for documentation review.
- Ensuring all tests pass, verifying the rebrand is complete from a technical standpoint.

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- Performing the actual rebrand (renaming files, updating code).
- Updating logos or other binary assets.
- Communicating the rebrand to external users (e.g., blog posts, release notes).

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] A new test file `tests/test_rebrand.py` is created.
- [ ] An automated test exists that fails if the term "Loom" is found in any `.py`, `.md`, or `.json` file in the project.
- [ ] All existing tests in the `tests/` directory pass successfully.
- [ ] A manual review of all files in the `documentation/` directory has been completed and signed off to ensure brand consistency.
