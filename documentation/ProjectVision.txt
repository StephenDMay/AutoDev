# Dev Issue Generator: Multi-Stage Pipeline Architecture

## Vision & Problem Statement

**Primary Goal**: Create a terminal-first tool that transforms vague feature requests into highly specific coding prompts that produce consistent, high-quality code generation from LLMs.

**Core Problem**: Current monolithic prompt approach produces inconsistent coding results because it optimizes for documentation quality rather than coding instruction quality.

**Key Insight**: The tool should function as a "coding prompt optimizer" - it doesn't generate code directly, but prepares the perfect prompt for another LLM to write excellent, consistent code.

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Coding-First Design
- **Primary Output**: Optimized coding prompts, not documentation
- **Success Metric**: Quality and consistency of generated code
- **Documentation**: Byproduct that supports workflow automation

### 2. Terminal-First Experience
- System-agnostic CLI tool
- Global installation via pipx (`pipx install dev-issue-generator`)
- Project-specific configuration
- Streamlined workflow integration

### 3. Pipeline Modularity
- Four discrete, cacheable stages
- Independent stage re-execution
- Clear separation of concerns
- Composable and testable components

### 4. LLM Agnostic
- Shell out to CLI tools (gemini, claude-code, openai)
- Provider-agnostic prompt templates
- Configurable LLM selection per stage

## Four-Stage Pipeline Architecture

### Stage 1: Pattern Extraction
**Purpose**: Analyze existing codebase to extract specific coding patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions.

**Input**: 
- Project configuration
- Codebase structure and sample files
- Tech stack and architecture context

**Processing**:
- File organization pattern analysis
- Implementation pattern identification
- Integration pattern discovery
- Code quality standard extraction

**Output**:
```
Pattern Name: API Controller Pattern
Implementation: UserController.create() with validation middleware
Rule: "When adding API endpoints, follow UserController.create() pattern with validation middleware"

Pattern Name: Database Model Pattern  
Implementation: extends BaseModel with audit fields
Rule: "New database models must extend BaseModel and include audit fields"

Pattern Name: Error Handling Pattern
Implementation: ApiError.badRequest() factory method
Rule: "Error responses use ApiError.badRequest() factory method"
```

**Cache Key**: Project structure hash + config version

### Stage 2: Integration Point Analysis
**Purpose**: Identify exact files, functions, and systems that will need modification for the requested feature.

**Input**:
- User feature request
- Extracted patterns from Stage 1
- Project structure

**Processing**:
- Primary integration point identification
- Data dependency mapping
- Interface requirement analysis
- Side effect assessment

**Output**:
```
Primary Integration Points:
- /controllers/UserController.js (add new endpoint)
- /models/User.js (add new fields)
- /routes/api.js (register new route)

Data Dependencies:
- Must use existing UserService for business logic
- Must use ValidationMiddleware for input validation
- Must use existing database connection pool

Interface Requirements:
- Implement IValidatable for new model fields
- Follow existing JWT authentication pattern
- Use established ApiResponse<T> wrapper

Side Effects:
- May require database migration
- Frontend authentication state may need updates
```

**Cache Key**: Feature request hash + Stage 1 output hash

### Stage 3: Implementation Constraints
**Purpose**: Define specific technical requirements that ensure new code fits seamlessly with existing patterns.

**Input**:
- Feature request
- Extracted patterns  
- Integration points

**Processing**:
- Required component identification
- Pattern compliance definition
- Anti-pattern avoidance rules
- Testing requirement specification

**Output**:
```
Must Use:
- UserService.validateUser() for authentication checks
- DatabaseManager.transaction() for multi-table operations
- Logger.info() with structured logging format

Must Follow:
- Async/await pattern for all database operations
- Input validation using Joi schemas
- Error handling with try/catch and ApiError wrappers

Must Avoid:
- Direct database queries (use service layer)
- Synchronous operations in request handlers
- Hard-coded configuration values

Must Test:
- Unit tests for service layer methods
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Error condition coverage for edge cases
```

**Cache Key**: Stage 2 output hash + constraint rules hash

### Stage 4: Coding Prompt Assembly
**Purpose**: Combine all previous outputs into a highly specific, optimized coding prompt for LLM code generation.

**Input**:
- All previous stage outputs
- User's original feature request
- Target LLM capabilities

**Processing**:
- Context aggregation and prioritization
- Code example selection and formatting
- Acceptance criteria refinement
- Prompt optimization for target LLM

**Output**:
```
ROLE: You are a senior [TECH_STACK] developer working on [PROJECT_NAME].

CONTEXT: [Specific codebase patterns and architectural decisions]

TASK: Implement [FEATURE_REQUEST] following these exact patterns:

REQUIRED PATTERNS:
[Code examples from existing codebase with explanations]

INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
[Specific files to modify and interfaces to implement]

CONSTRAINTS:
[Must use/follow/avoid/test requirements]

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
[Specific, testable requirements derived from analysis]

CODE EXAMPLES TO EMULATE:
[Relevant code snippets from existing codebase]
```

**Cache Key**: All previous stage hashes + target LLM identifier

## Caching Strategy

### Cache Architecture
- **Stage-Level Caching**: Each stage output cached independently
- **Dependency Tracking**: Cache invalidation based on input changes
- **Selective Re-execution**: Only re-run stages with invalidated inputs

### Cache Storage
- Local file system cache in project directory
- JSON format for structured data
- Hash-based cache keys for reliability
- Configurable cache expiration

### Cache Benefits
- **Performance**: Avoid re-processing unchanged inputs
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduce LLM API calls
- **Iteration Speed**: Fast prompt refinement cycles
- **Debugging**: Inspect intermediate stage outputs

## Distribution Strategy & Open Source Approach

### Strategic Decision: Open Source First

Based on the terminal-first, system-agnostic architecture and the community-driven nature of developer tooling, this project will follow an **open source first** distribution strategy.

#### Open Source Benefits

**Community-Driven Template Evolution**: The pipeline's success depends on high-quality stage templates. Open source enables community contributions of templates for different tech stacks, architectural patterns, and use cases:
- React developers contribute frontend-specific pattern extraction templates
- Backend engineers optimize API constraint definitions  
- DevOps teams share deployment and infrastructure patterns
- Enterprise teams contribute security and compliance templates

**Terminal-First Philosophy Alignment**: The system-agnostic, CLI-first approach naturally aligns with open source tooling culture. Developers who prefer terminal workflows are comfortable with open source tools and actively contribute to projects they use daily.

**Pattern Database Network Effects**: More projects using the tool means better pattern extraction for everyone. Open source creates incentives for sharing anonymized pattern databases across projects, improving results through collective intelligence.

**LLM Provider Independence**: The multi-provider architecture (gemini, claude-code, openai) benefits from community testing across diverse providers, models, and use cases. This diversity strengthens the core system's reliability and performance.

**Technical Validation at Scale**: Open source accelerates discovery and resolution of edge cases across diverse codebases, tech stacks, and development workflows that would be impossible to test in isolation.
