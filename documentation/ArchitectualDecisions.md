# Architectural Decisions and Outcomes

## Context Passing Strategy

### Decision Status: ✅ DECIDED

### Question:
Do you want agents to pass full context objects, or should each agent only receive the minimal data it needs? The latter is cleaner but requires more orchestration logic.

### Context:
Each agent is responsible for building their own section of the final master prompt. Agents will perform their domain-specific analysis (via LLM) and produce written breakdowns that get compiled into a comprehensive coding prompt for the final LLM coding agent.

### Considerations:
- Full context approach: Simpler implementation, agents can access any data they need
- Minimal context approach: Better separation of concerns, more explicit interfaces
- Performance implications of context size
- Debugging and transparency requirements

### Outcome:
**DECISION: Full Context Objects**

Rationale:
- Cross-pollination benefits: Research agent can reference project patterns, later agents can validate against earlier findings
- Quality improvement: Comprehensive understanding leads to better analysis
- Flexibility: Agents can adapt analysis based on complete context
- Debugging: Full context makes pipeline decisions traceable
- Performance acceptable: Dealing with text summaries, not raw data

## Cache Granularity

### Decision Status: ✅ DECIDED

### Question:
Should caching happen at the agent level (each agent can cache its output) or at the orchestrator level (pipeline-wide caching)? 

### Considerations:
- Agent-level gives more flexibility but adds complexity
- Orchestrator-level is simpler but less granular
- Performance and cost optimization needs
- Philosophy of meeting developers where they are with complete flexibility

### Outcome:
**DECISION: Agent-Level Caching**

Rationale:
- Aligns with app philosophy of complete flexibility
- Orchestrator focuses on its main task - orchestrating
- More granular cache invalidation saves costs on expensive LLM calls
- Individual agents can implement domain-specific caching strategies
- Better performance optimization at the agent level
- Supports stateless agent design while maintaining efficiency

## Agent Configuration

### Decision Status: ✅ DECIDED

### Question:
Should agents have their own configuration sections, or should they all consume the same project config?

### Considerations:
- Some agents might need specialized settings
- Configuration complexity vs. simplicity
- Maintenance overhead
- Alignment with "meet developers where they are" philosophy

### Outcome:
**DECISION: Agent-Specific Configuration Sections**

Rationale:
- Maximum developer choice: Different agents can use optimal LLM providers for their tasks
- Progressive enhancement: Shared defaults with agent-specific overrides
- Future-proofing: New agents can add specialized configuration needs
- Cost optimization: Teams can use expensive models where they add most value
- Developer experience: Power users get full control, beginners get sensible defaults
- Aligns perfectly with philosophy of complete flexibility and meeting developers where they are

## Error Boundaries

### Decision Status: ✅ DECIDED

### Question:
When an agent fails, should the pipeline halt completely, continue with cached/default data, or allow manual intervention?

### Considerations:
- User experience and automation goals
- Recovery strategies
- Debugging and troubleshooting needs
- LLM failure modes (rate limits, timeouts, model refusals)
- Alignment with "meet developers where they are" philosophy

### Outcome:
**DECISION: Hybrid Approach with Configuration**

Rationale:
- Configurable failure behavior per agent allows maximum flexibility
- Developers can specify retry counts, fallback strategies, and timeout settings
- Agents can be marked as "required" vs "optional" 
- Supports various fallback strategies: use cache, use defaults, skip agent, halt pipeline
- Maintains automation benefits while giving developers control
- Fits perfectly with "meet developers where they are" philosophy

## LLM Provider Per Agent

### Decision Status: ✅ DECIDED

### Question:
Do you want the ability to use different LLM providers for different agents (e.g., Claude for research, GPT for code generation), or keep it uniform across the pipeline?

### Considerations:
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Model-specific strengths and weaknesses
- Configuration complexity
- Testing and validation overhead
- Developer choice and flexibility

### Outcome:
**DECISION: Different LLM Providers Per Agent**

Rationale:
- Maximum flexibility: Users configure providers wherever they feel necessary
- Cost burden shifted to users: They decide when/where to use expensive models
- Leverage model-specific strengths for optimal results
- Supports teams with different provider access/preferences
- Future enterprise feature opportunity: Automatic cost reduction measures
- Aligns with "meet developers where they are" philosophy
- Enables provider diversification and resilience strategies
