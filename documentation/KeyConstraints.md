## Key Constraints to Consider

### 1. **Model API Differences**
- **Token limits** vary wildly (4K to 2M+)
- **Output formats** aren't standardized (JSON modes, structured outputs, etc.)
- **Rate limits** differ by provider
- **API interfaces** aren't uniform (streaming, function calling, tool use)
- **Context window handling** - some models lose coherence at scale

### 2. **Context Management**
- How to handle projects larger than any model's context window
- Efficient chunking strategies that preserve coherence
- Which context matters for which task (implementation needs different context than review)
- Context switching costs between models

### 3. **Output Consistency**
- Different models have different "styles" and formatting preferences
- Ensuring structured data remains parseable across models
- Handling model-specific quirks (some are chatty, others terse)
- Maintaining code style consistency when using multiple models

### 4. **Error Handling & Reliability**
- Models fail differently (timeouts, refusals, hallucinations)
- Some models are more prone to making up libraries/functions
- Validation becomes critical when you can't trust consistent behavior
- Need fallback strategies for each pipeline stage

### 5. **State Management**
- How to track progress across a multi-step, multi-model pipeline
- Resumability when a step fails
- Versioning as models update and behave differently
- Rollback capabilities

### 6. **Security & Privacy**
- Different models have different data retention policies
- Some organizations can't use certain cloud models
- Need to support local/private models for sensitive codebases
- API key management across multiple providers

### 7. **Cost Predictability**
- Wildly different pricing models (per token, per request, flat rate)
- Hard to estimate costs when models can choose different approaches
- Some models are verbose, others concise (affects token usage)
- Need cost caps and warnings

### 8. **Performance Optimization**
- Parallel execution opportunities vs. sequential dependencies
- Caching strategies (which results are reusable?)
- When to batch vs. stream
- Balancing latency vs. throughput

### 9. **Human-in-the-Loop Challenges**
- Where to insert approval checkpoints without killing automation benefits
- How to present intermediate results for review
- Handling partial implementations
- Making the pipeline debuggable

### 10. **Project Understanding**
- Teaching new models about project conventions quickly
- Handling custom frameworks/patterns
- Dealing with legacy code that doesn't follow modern patterns
- Maintaining architectural decisions across model switches

### Potential Solutions to Consider:

**Abstraction Layer**: Build a robust interface that normalizes model differences
```python
class ModelAdapter:
    def generate(self, prompt, **kwargs):
        # Handle model-specific quirks here
        pass
```

**Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic features that work everywhere, add model-specific optimizations as optional enhancements

**Explicit Contracts**: Define clear interfaces between pipeline stages that any model must fulfill

**Defensive Programming**: Always validate outputs, never trust any single model completely

**Graceful Degradation**: If a preferred model fails, automatically fall back to alternatives

The key is building resilience into the system from day one, assuming models will behave differently and planning for that variation.
