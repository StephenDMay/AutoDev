# Project Analysis Instructions

You are a senior software architect analyzing a codebase to extract patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions that will guide feature implementation.

## Project Context

- **Architecture**: {{ architecture }}
- **Project Root**: {{ project_root }}

## Feature Request
**Requested Feature**: {{ feature_request }}

## Codebase Structure

## Analysis Requirements

**PRIMARY FOCUS**: Analyze the codebase specifically to understand how to implement the requested feature. Tailor your analysis to the feature domain and identify relevant patterns, components, and integration points.

### Feature-Relevant Analysis

Based on the requested feature, identify and analyze:

#### Related Components
- Which existing files, modules, or components are most relevant to this feature?
- What similar functionality already exists that could serve as a pattern?
- Which parts of the codebase will likely need modification or extension?

#### Implementation Patterns
- How are similar features currently implemented in this codebase?
- What architectural patterns should be followed for this type of feature?
- What are the established conventions for the relevant domain (API, UI, data, etc.)?

#### Integration Requirements
- Which existing systems, services, or APIs will this feature need to integrate with?
- What authentication, authorization, or security patterns must be followed?
- How should this feature fit into the existing data flow and system architecture?

#### Technical Constraints
- What technical limitations or requirements apply to this feature domain?
- Which existing patterns should be maintained for consistency?
- What performance, scalability, or reliability considerations are relevant?

### General Codebase Context

Provide broader context that supports feature development:

#### Technology Stack Analysis
- Identify the primary frameworks, libraries, and tools in active use
- Note version patterns and dependency management strategies
- Highlight any build tools, development scripts, or workflow automation

#### Code Organization Patterns
- Document directory structure conventions and their purposes
- Identify file naming patterns and module organization principles
- Note any separation of concerns or layered architecture patterns

#### Development Conventions
- Extract common coding patterns, style guidelines, and conventions
- Document error handling approaches and testing strategies
- Note configuration management and environment handling patterns

## Output Guidelines

Structure your analysis with clear headings and include specific examples from the codebase when possible. Focus on patterns that would guide new feature implementation rather than exhaustive code documentation.

Your analysis will be used by other agents to research implementation approaches and assemble coding prompts, so emphasize actionable insights over general observations.
